# Identifying-the-Movie-Success-Rate

Description: To Determine the success rate of a movie based using multiple classifiers
Environment: Anaconda Python 3.5, libraries: numpy, sklearn, matplotlib 
•	Shortlisted a dataset - IMDB movie dataset from Kaggle
•	Pruned and processed the data to perform predictions and provide an analysis.
•      Split the data into a training set & a testing set to identfy the best algorithm among Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes Classifier and Adaboost with Decision Tree.
•      Determined the results of each algorithm in the form of Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Recall and Precsion rate 
•      Performed a detailed analysis of the effect of various attributes on the success rate of a movie. These attributes include rating, votes, actors, directors, revenue and metascore.
